Welcome to The Ecosystem!
===================================
Howdy! Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!
This is a website I've been working on since May 2020 as a way to refresh my skills in HTML, CSS, and JS while also learning some new stuff with Python and SQL
Hopefully you enjoy looking over my work, and contact me with any suggestions or notes!
