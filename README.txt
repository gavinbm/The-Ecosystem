Status Updates
====================================
Deployment/Hosting - Projected finished in January
  - This was hosted on a Linode server but I had
    to remove it to use that server for my job as this
    projet was originally just used as a testing ground for
    features that we wanted to add to that site
  - I plan on hosting this on a Raspberry Pi once my
    residence is more permanent and I get a new Pi
  - I know how to do it with Apache2, but I think
    I'll give Nginx a try since it's more modern

Account system - Finished 9/14/2020
  - Stores user data in a SQLite database
  - Checks for unique username via SQL query
